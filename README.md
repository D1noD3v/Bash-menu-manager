# Linux Menu Manager

A Linux file/user/group manager made for Debian-based linux machines, specifically distro Ubuntu.

The program was made to make it easier for new linux users to navigate the terminal and edit/change different configurations.
Such as: Creating files, Creating new users, Modifying files, Modifying user configs and much more.

This was made as the Case assignment for the DVA249 linux course at Mälardalens University.
